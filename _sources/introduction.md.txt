# Introduction

This documentation aims to cover everything you need to know to use aiomqtt in your projects. We expect some knowledge of MQTT and asyncio, but we try to explain things as clearly as possible. If you get stuck, don't hesitate to start a new discussion on GitHub. We're happy to help!

If you're new to MQTT, we recommend reading the [HiveMQ MQTT essentials](https://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-essentials/) guide as an introduction. Afterward, the [OASIS specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/mqtt-v5.0.html) is a great reference. For asyncio, we recommend the [RealPython asyncio walkthrough](https://realpython.com/async-io-python/) as an introduction and the [asyncio docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) as a reference.
